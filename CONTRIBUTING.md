## Development Setup

Open the repository in VSCode, run `bun watch` and then press F5 to open a VSCode window with the extension running.
Click the restart button (or reload the window in the debugged VSCode) whenever you make any changes.

Running the e2e tests with `bun run test-e2e` requires having the jinjahtml-vscode extension adjacent to this repository.
