# Jinja LSP

## Acknowledgements

- The [language](./packages/language/) package is based on [@huggingface/jinja](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface.js/tree/main/packages/jinja), licensed under MIT by Hugging Face.
- The client is heavily based on [jinjahtml-vscode](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/jinjahtml-vscode), licensed under MIT by Samuel Colvin and other Contributors. In particular, the awesome syntaxes and the language configuration are included as-is!
